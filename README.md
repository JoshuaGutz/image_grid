# image_grid
A web app grid of square images that change on hover and resize based on the window

To use: just have chrome installed and run the shortcut file "Image Grid"

This has a target of `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c start chrome.exe --app="%cd%\index.html"` and the "Start in" is empty so the %cd% works.
